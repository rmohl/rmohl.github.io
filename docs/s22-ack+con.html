            <p>
                I would firstly like to thank Spencer Ploeger, my coworker Aidan Holvik, and our lab partner Alec MacLean for making my summer infinitely more fun and for being great friends! You were all exceptionally easy to work with and made me excited to come into work every day. I would like to further thank Spencer for being a fantastic project lead - Aidan and I were able to learn so much thanks to your trust in our abilities and supportive leadership this summer. Thanks to Professor Mohammed Biglarbegian for organizing this opportunity, and thanks to Professor Thorsteinn Jonsson for taking time out of his busy schedule to give us feedback on the project and advice for future implementation.
                <br><br>
                Overall, working as an Undergraduate Research Assistant at the University of Guelph was a really unique co-op experience. This position gave me a lot of freedom when it came to deciding what parts of the project I wanted to work on. I was able to gain experience working in a co-op environment where I had equal say in all meetings and discussions. Everyone I worked with this summer was amazing - the co-op term was fantastic and inspired me to pursue my masters after I complete my undergraduate degree. Thanks for the incredible summer!
