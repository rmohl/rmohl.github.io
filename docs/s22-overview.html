          <h1> OVERVIEW </h1>
          <p>
            While working towards my Computer Science degree at the University of Guelph, I have come to find that I have a passion for linguistics and its many applications in technology today. Neural networks have a major role in the field of linguistics, allowing for machine translation and speech recognition. I am heavily considering pursuing a career relating to both computer science and linguistics, and my co-op position this summer helped give me a headstart on this future goal of mine by introducing me to neural networks. During the Summer 2022 semester, my role as an Undergraduate Research Assistant at the University of Guelph gave me the opportunity to learn more about machine learning and robotics, and how these topics can be applied in real-world scenarios. The machine learning aspect of this position allowed me to learn about a variety of different neural networks, how they work, and what they can be used for.

            In this report, I will go into further detail about my employer, what our team goals were for this summer, what my role was in this project, and my work term learning goals to provide a comprehensive summary of what I was able to accomplish during my third co-op work term!
