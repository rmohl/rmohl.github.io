            <h1> LEARNING GOALS </h1>

            <h2>1. Learn more about job-related technology and take initiative to engage whenever optional training sessions or workshops relating to technical aspects of the position arise.</h3>
            <p> While working this summer, I learned a lot about technology in the healthcare industry through using programs like COVaxON, Verto Flow, and by gaining a general understanding of electronic medical record software applications like PS Suite and Epic. I was also able to attend all of the optional co-op workshops that I was available for, in which I learned more about the field of Health Informatics, how to be successful in job interviews, how to create successful resumes and cover letters, and how to make effective connections with others in similar industries.</p>

            <h2>2. Improve organizational and time management skills.</h3>
            <p> I chose this as one of my work term learning goals as this job had inconsistent shift times that took place at a variety of different locations throughout the summer. At first, it was difficult to adjust to my work schedule, but I was able to quickly develop strategies that helped me arrive at the proper location and time for each shift, keep track of on-site technical equipment, and communicate any issues regarding my schedule or the clinic equipment with one of my supervisors as soon as I was able. Some of these strategies included checking my shift times and locations multiple times and at least a day before I left for my shift, preemptively planning what route I would take to get to each clinic and where I would park once I arrived, and writing down the number of iPads provided at the beginning of the day to ensure that the correct amount were returned at the end of each clinic.</p>

            <h2>3. Develop my oral communication skills when it came to explaining technical issues that I encountered on the job.</h3>
            <p> Once I had more experience working at pop-up clinics, I was able to lead the IT Support portion of daily staff meetings by going over the general flow of COVaxON and warning staff about technical issues that were most commonly encountered throughout the day. When my position focused more on providing support for patients using myHealthRecord, I often handled technical issues over the phone. In many calls, I explained why the patient was dealing with certain errors, and what steps they had to take to fix the problem. This work term gave me many opportunities to explain technical issues that I was knowledgeable about, which allowed me to gain confidence in my communication abilities.</p>
