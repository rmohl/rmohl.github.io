            <h1> LEARNING GOALS </h1>

            <h2>1. Develop a deeper understanding of machine learning with a focus on neural networks.</h3>
            <p> Throughout the summer I got plenty of hands-on opportunities to learn more about neural networks. At the beginning of my work term, I was really intimidated by machine learning and the idea of neural networks, as I had no prior experience with any of these concepts. The first task I was given regarding neural networks was to use PyTorch to make a simple function approximator for the most basic linear equation, y = x, and later I was given the more challenging task of creating a function approximator for y = x<sup>2</sup>. Implementing these function approximators allowed me to get a basic understanding of simple neural networks. During the work term, I was able to create a convolutional neural network that functioned as a map encoder/decoder, and later worked on a long short-term memory neural network that functioned as a path planner. I was also able to use programs like Weights and Biases and Tensorboard to analyze hyperparameters and fine tune the neural networks I was working with. Overall, I was able to learn a lot about neural networks and their applications!</p>

            <h2>2. Learn more about robotics concepts like path planning on a known map, different types of controllers, and testing in both real and simulated environments.</h3>
            <p> One of the first project-related tasks I was given this summer was to implement a simulation of A* and RRT* algorithms to create paths. We found the RRT* algorithm to be more effective for our project goals as its output was different every time it ran, which was ideal for creating a variety of different paths that could be used as test data. I was able to learn about and use the Robot Operating System (ROS), RViz, and Gazebo to create and save maps, set up and run simulations, and understand robot controls in a simulated environment. Once we had simple path planners set up, I learned about PID controllers and helped create code for a PD controller. Near the end of the summer, we went to the National Research Centre in London, Ontario to test our code on a real RBKairos robot. These experiences all contributed to my goal of learning more about path planning and robotics.</p>

            <h2>3. Improve my skill when it comes to writing project reports, contributing to conference papers, and helping create academic papers.</h3>
            <p> I was told at the beginning of my work term that I was required to write a final report at the end of the summer on all my contributions to the project. Additionally, throughout the semester I was asked to write short reports in LaTeX on certain aspects of the project I worked on - this helped communicate my findings in a condensed, but organized manner. To help write these reports, I made sure to keep track of what tasks I was given and took daily notes on what I worked on. I also made sure to regularly push to the project Git repository. After the work term was completed, I was given the opportunity to be a supporting author on my first ever academic paper. I helped contribute to Spencer’s graduate project paper <i>Investigation of Stochastic Deep Learning Path Planning Methods for Mobile Robots</i>, in which I created pseudocode, wrote about the sorting and conditioning of the NDM-GAN planner’s output data, and discussed aspects of the S-LSTM planner’s design.</p>
