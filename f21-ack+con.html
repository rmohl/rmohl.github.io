                I would like to thank my supervisors Kellen Bailey and Jon Lam for being extremely supportive and motivating throughout my work term, for encouraging me to pursue an intriguing technical role in the future, and for providing amazing feedback throughout my co-op term. I really appreciate the work you put into helping me learn and grow this semester - all your effort will help me succeed in my future career. Thanks to those I worked with on the <i>AUTOMATE</i> team; Nisarg Dalvi, Thomas Kim, Emily Guglielmi, and Charles Stever of the Deceptiducks, and Sam McIlveen, Garrett Randall, Mariel Martinez, and Kieran Cunny of the Dinobots. Thanks to Jason Wood for being a welcoming and fun engineering manager. Thanks to Sharvil Pandya for helping me get oriented at Magnet Forensics and for organizing fun events for all the co-op students this fall. Thanks to Yan Huang for his hard work organizing the delivery, maintenance, and return of all the technical equipment used by co-op students during the work term. Thanks to Adam Belsher and Jad Saliba for launching a fantastic company and for truly wanting to make the world a better place.

                Overall, working as a software developer at Magnet Forensics was an awesome experience. Everyone I interacted with was welcoming and encouraging, and I was able to learn so much about the cybersecurity industry and the field of digital forensics. I am proud to say I was a part of such an amazing company! Thanks for the incredible work term.
