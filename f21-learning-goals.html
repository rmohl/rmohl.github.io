            <h1> LEARNING GOALS </h1>

            <h2>1. Learn more about how a software development team works together to complete tasks and to learn more about the roles and career backgrounds of my co-workers.</h3>
            <p> During this work term, my team organized their tasks using the Kanban strategy, which allowed me to learn the most important aspects of this AGILE methodology. I was also able to learn the difference between the Scrum and Kanban approaches in team programming. My team had daily standup meetings, bi-weekly refine and replenish meetings, bi-weekly retrospective meetings, and monthly all-hands meetings. I was able to learn why these meetings were held and what were generally discussed, allowing me to confidently contribute by the end of my placement. Throughout the one-on-one meetings I had with my supervisors and coworkers, I took the initiative to ask about their roles at the company and how they got to where they are today. This helped me learn a lot about possible future career paths in the technical industry and allowed me to better connect with the people who I was working with.</p>

            <h2>2. Learn about Magnet <i>AUTOMATE</i> - the product I worked on - and the technology I used while working here.</h3>
            <p> Magnet <i>AUTOMATE</i> allows users to connect a host computer and a lab of agent computers, after which a digital forensics workflow can be created. It then keeps track of what digital forensics software is available across all agent computers to optimize the workflow and allow for faster forensic analysis. I learned how to use common <i>AUTOMATE</i> features like how to set up host and agent computers, how to create and manage a workflow, how to upload evidence, and more. I also gained a better understanding of the code and how to find a specific section when I was given new program errors to work on. I gained more experience with technology I was already quite comfortable with like JavaScript, React, and Git, and was pleased to learn about and work with technology I had never or rarely worked with before like Redux, Clojure, a bit of C#, Gerrit, Jira, Jenkins, some SQLite, Clojure unit tests, the JavaScript Jest library, and Cypress for end-to-end testing.</p>

            <h2>3. Develop my ability to initiate asking for help when I need it.</h3>
            <p> For the first half of my placement, this learning goal was difficult for me to work on. It was my first time working in a software developer position, as well as my first time programming in a professional team setting, and I didn’t want to let my coworkers down. Throughout the work term, I developed strategies to balance knowing when I should keep trying to solve an issue, and knowing when I should ask for help. Magnet Forensics had a big role in helping me work on this learning goal, as the company provided a “buddy system” in which one of my senior coworkers, Jon, had the responsibility of supporting me throughout my work term. As my co-op placement went on, I got more comfortable with my team, learned more about how my coworkers solved issues that were new to them, and picked up some of their strategies. I focused less on how I would be “slowing others down” and more on the idea that I was going to learn something new. By the end of my work term, I felt a lot more comfortable when asking for help, and I did it more often!</p>
