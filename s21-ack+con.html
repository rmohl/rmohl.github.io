            <p> 
                I would like to say thanks to my manager Dhara Desai, and supervisors Alyssa Furfaro-Argier, Rahmeet Khokhar, and Jennifer Pinto, for being amazing leaders, for running a fantastic co-op program, and for supporting me throughout the work term. Thanks to those part of the IT/IM Department at Women’s College Hospital who had a huge role in supervising me and the other Health Informatics students throughout the summer; Swati Makol, Ameet Mathrani, Zuhour Nur, Phillippe Bicos, and Eddy Draycott. Thanks to my fellow Health Informatics Practicum Student coworkers; Maha Zeb, Chanpreet Litt, Stephanie Pinto, Morgan Kaneshakumar, and Mariano Kanagaratnam, for being amazing coworkers, as well as great friends. Thanks to all other members of the Women’s College Hospital IT/IM Department that made each day working at the hospital more fun. Finally, a big thanks to all the clinic site leads, medical leads, vaccinators, registration staff, inventory staff, and everyone else who I was lucky to have the opportunity to work with at various Women’s College pop-up clinics throughout the summer. 
                <br><br>
                I was honestly blown away at how motivating, supportive, and kind everyone was. Working as a Health Informatics Practicum Student at Women’s College Hospital was an amazing experience - I was able to meet many great people, make awesome friends, learn important employment skills, and learn so much about the field of Health Informatics and technology in the healthcare industry. I will definitely miss working here, it was a pleasure working with you all!
