            <h1> About Employer </h1>
            <p> 
                In 1883, Women’s College Hospital was founded by Dr. Emily Stowe under the name of Woman’s Medical College. Dr. Stowe was the second woman to ever receive a medical license in Canada and was determined to provide more Canadian women with the opportunity to work as a licensed medical professional. 
                <br><br>
                Today, Women’s College Hospital is a world leader in health for women, health equity, and revolutionary health system solutions. The organization aims to provide effective and equitable medical services by working hard to close gender-related and social health gaps present throughout the healthcare industry.
                <br><br>
                Women’s College Hospital has set many important healthcare milestones, some include being:  
                <ul>
                    <li>Involved in one of the most important breakthroughs in cancer research - the discovery of the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes as breast cancer risks</li>
                    <li>The first Ontarian hospital to have a Sexual Assault Care Centre</li>
                    <li>The first Ontarian hospital to have an independent Ambulatory Care Centre</li>
                    <li>The first Ontarian hospital to use mammography as a diagnostic tool to detect breast cancer</li>
                    <li>A collaborator in the invention of the simplified Pap test</li>
                </ul>
                And much more!
